                    “I’m so happy with the transformation of my space! The Colors United team took my old, drab basement and turned it into a place filled with light! 
                    The new flooring and upgraded bathroom and kitchen are just what we wanted. They were highly professional and took care to keep things neat and contained. 
                    Thanks so much for the hard work! We love our new hangout area!”

                    We recently bought a home and completely turned it over to them to transform before move-in day. 
                    Everything was professional, high quality, and priced fairly. A+ experience!”
